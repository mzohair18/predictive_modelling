# predictive_modelling
The used_cars dataset is a collection of information about used cars. It includes information on the carâ€™s make, model, year, price, fuel efficiency, engine specifications,horsepower and much_more. I have performed data analysis by cleaning,exploring the dataset(EDA) using pandas and visualizing different reggression plots using searborn on the dataset to understand the factors that affect car prices.The dataset can be used to predict the price of a used car by using the famous machine learning Python library sklearn
